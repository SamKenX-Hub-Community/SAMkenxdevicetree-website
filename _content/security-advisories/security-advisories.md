# June 2016
## Bleichenbacher signature forgery attack
#### Description
A vulnerability in the [OP-TEE] project was found by Intel Security Advanced
Threat Research in June 2016. It appeared that OP-TEE was vulnerable to
[Bleichenbacher signature forgery attack](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/openpgp/current/msg00999.html).

The problem lies in the [LibTomCrypt] code in OP-TEE, that neglects to check
that the message length is equal to the ASN.1 encoded data length. Upstream
LibTomCrypt already had a
[fix](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt/commit/5eb9743410ce4657e9d54fef26a2ee31a1b5dd0)
and there was also a [test
case](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt/commit/d51715db728d99954219cc42b013db6e48db65),
verifying that the fix resolved the issue.

The fixes from upstream LibTomCrypt has been cherry-picked into OP-TEE. The fix
for TEE core can be found upstream in
[this](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/commit/30d13250c390c4f56adefdcd3b64b7cc672f9fe2)
patch and a test case has been added to the test suite for OP-TEE and that
can also be found upstream in
[this](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_test/commit/b58916e35fe1f73cb7d32eb5ac04ab66f59669)
patch.
