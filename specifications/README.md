## **The Devicetree Specification**

<a href="https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/releases/download/v0.2/devicetree-specification-v0.2.pdf" target="\_blank">
<strong>Device Tree Specification Release 0.2</strong>
</a>
<br>

This is the first formal baseline release of the device tree specification. This document is a first iteration of ePAPR 1.1 and picks up where it left off in 2012.
The next release v0.2 is due to be tagged before the end of December 2017.
It is currently in prerelease form and available for review on the
[Releases](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/releases) page in the GitHub project.

We plan to make a full v1.0 release once there are enough contributions to
bring the specification document up to date with current core DT bindings as
used by the Linux kernel.

If you would like to get involved please fetch the document source from
[GitHub](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification)
and join the [mailing list](http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#devicetree-spec).
Comments and patches are welcome at any time!

A second major release should then cover new features.
Once agreed by the TSC, the timeline for planned future releases will be
shown [here](/releases/) and you can always find the latest release,
as well as all older releases, in our GitHub repository:
